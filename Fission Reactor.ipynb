These follow the (R,G,B,A) structure, where R, G, B refer to the amount of red, green and blue making up the colour ranging between 0-255 with 0 being no colour and 255 being maximum colour.

A surface is used in Pygame to represent the appearance of an object and give it colour, with surfaces being used to generate all the buttons, text and backgrounds.

    "### Selecting moderator\n",
    "For modelling our fission reactor, it was important to figure out the moderator and coolant that would be best to use. In order to do this it was important to get some numbers so that we could rank a few moderators to pick the best one.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Second is a function for calculating the slowing down power. It quantifies how good a moderator is at scattering neutrons. This should be large as neutrons should be scattered as much as possible inside a moderator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third is a function for calculating the moderating ratio. This quantifies how good of a moderator a material is by account for the logarithmic energy loss, scattering cross section and absoption cross section. This should be as large as possible. Ideally absoprtion cross section is small for a good moderator as neutrons should not be absorbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally a function for calculating the number of collisions to thermalise is calculated. This is the number of collisions required on average to bring a neutron released from fission to thermal speeds (able to induce further fission). This should be low as less collisions required means the moderator can be thinner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing done in this code cell is writing all of the moderator details to their own dictionary and then adding these dictionaries to a Pandas dataframe to visualise the results."

This scale factor also includes the factors of the nuclear reactor such as the amount of energy required to heat the coolant and also vaporise it as well as the efficiencies of all the heat transfers. We have had to multiply our power output by a scale factor because modelling a proper chain reaction is incredibly commputationally challenging, with just the depth of 12 we have considered requiring 1s to carry out the calculations, and anything above a depth of 16 took more than 30 seconds to complete, with the processing time increasing exponentially. \n",

Although simply blitting different surfaces onto the screen would suffice in most cases, we need there to be three completely different menus so we deemed it important to have different procedures (not functions as they do not return a value) that would each represent a different screen. This would allow three seperate game loops that all use the same window to show what we need it to show. When a certain button is pressed, the appropriate function is called to switch the game loop that is running."

The control rods are added to this group in a for loop, to ensure that there are a constant number of control rods that can be changed by the variable NUMBER_OF_CONTROL_RODS. Their position on the screen is determined by the position of the first control rods top left corner. An offset is added onto the x coordinate depending upon which control rod is being placed on the screen (the control rod on the furthest right has the largest offset).\n",

    "The insertion percentage of the control rods is modified using the buttons at the top right. These allow the insertion percentage to be changed in increments of 0.1%, 1.0% and 5.0%. This is done by first checking if the movement will take the control rods outside of the allowed range of 0-100 % insertion. If the move is allowed, then all control rods in the ControlRodGroup sprite group are looped over, and all have the MoveUp or MoveDown method called depending upon which button is pressed and the appropriate relativeShift is passed as a parameter. These methods work by moving the control rods vertically by relativeShift*height each time a button is pressed. \n",
    "\n",
    "If this was to reimplemented, the insertion depth only needs to be checked once outside the ControlRod class, to ensure that each function/procedure has only one job. Another bug is that when the user presses the return button whilst the control rods are inserted and then presses start again, the insertion percentage at the top goes back to 0% but the control rods stay inserted. This is a relatively simple fix and the code will just need some refactoring to prevent this in future."
